# Summary

- DNA storage
- Fehlerkorrektur
- DMR Verfahren mehr eingehen

# Statement of need

- DNA speicher 
- verschiedene Fehlerkorrekturverfahren vorhanden
- mÃ¶glichst gute Korrekturmethode finden 
- andere nennen --> meist nur subs fehler, oft mit RS gekoppelt

DMR is a method for encoding bits in DNA and then decoding them. The method is based on a mapping table, which is used for the translation and also gives 
the dynamic mapping rule its name. With the help of this mapping table, a self-correction of the DNA sequence is to be achieved. In addition, the coding 
was combined with RS so that the correction with the DMR scheme can be validated with the help of RS and thus leads to a better correction than the stand-alone 
use of DMR or RS. 
In addition, the use of the DMR scheme offers the possibility to localize incorrect areas of the DNA by comparison with the mapping possibilities and thus 
to carry out targeted corrective procedures at the affected sites. This should make it possible to correct substitution errors as well as insertion and 
deletion errors. For the correction, the levels must be adapted and expanded accordingly so that an optimal correction can be achieved. The current correction 
is only suitable for the correction of substitution errors, but it is possible to extend it for the correction of insertion and deletion errors.
